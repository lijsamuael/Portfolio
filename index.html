            <p>But i have encountered a great problem in my software eingineering study and the reason is that most of my classmates are fairly familiar with progrmmig concepts and they have learnt if from primary school.And this mekes it difficult to compete
                with them. But I never give up I tried a lot and work hard on the bare.But know I am training myself and i am gitting a good improvement on my abilities</p>
